## Processes

- **Program**: compiled executable file
- **Process**: a running program
- The CPU can execute instructions from memory
    - Therefore a program must be in memory to run
- To begin executing a program, the OS will allocate space in memory for the program to run
    - OS neatly organizes everything before executing the program and starting the process
- **syscalls** can be used to control processes
    - Core syscalls include: **fork()**, **exec()**, **wait()**
